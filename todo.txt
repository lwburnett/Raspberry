Features
	- "Active Reload" for rowing
	- Some sort of positive collectable to offset the dodging of obstacles

Optimization
	- *Put generation in background thread
		(Instead I spread tile generation out to only do 5 tiles per frame

Art
	- Add Menus
	- *Add little particles that flow through the river
	- *Add grass tiles above and below shoreline
	- *Area of influence shader around the player that shows the river within but the desert without

Bugs
	-* Acceleration when travelling backwards
	-* Travelling backwards allows the user to double count sections of river for distance travelled
	- Rocks sometimes places badly at transitions
	- Transitions at shoreline are sometimes blocky and choppy
	- Transition segments sometimes calculate the wrong starting slope
	- River particles display outside of the player proximity
	- Rocks have a wake outside of player proximity
