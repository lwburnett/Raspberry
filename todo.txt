---------------------- Sprint Priority ----------------------

Must
	o Feature: While turning, add some lateral force to the boat that scales with speed relative to water
	o Feature: Increase rotational force if turning while rowing
	o Balance: Make energy spawns more frequent at the beginning and less frequent at the end
	o Feature: Increase collision radius of energy
	o Balance: Increase impact radius decay and passive radius decay with distance

Should
	o Feature: Update tutorial to inform player how passive and collision energy decay scale with distance
	- Art: Recolor rocks
	o Art: Iterate on energy art
	- Art: Iterate on generated tile art

Could
	o Art: Add in another unique rock sprite
	- Art: Some sort of hazy effect or particle effect on the circumfrence of the player proximity ring
	- Feature: Settings screen
	o Feature: Post play stats screen

-------------------- Playtester Feedback --------------------

- Movement still feels like asteroids (nolan)
	- After turning, convert some speed from old vector to new vector. Amount converted should scale with speed relative to water
- Movement is too fast (nick)


------------------------ Outstanding ------------------------

Features
	- Daily challenge map based on today's date
	- Settings to turn off music & sound fx
	- Add Screens
		- Main Menu
		- Settings screen? (Might not actually need this)
			- Music toggle
			- SFX toggle
			- Screen shake toggle
		- Stats screen? (With things like # of attempts, best run, average run, etc.)
	- Screen shake on collision
	- Rapids section where the water speed temporarily gets way faster???
		- Match up rapids section with drop in music?

Optimization

Art
	- *Some sort of hazy effect or particle effect on the circumfrence of the player proximity ring
	- *Iterate on generated tile art
	- *Change rocks' color pallete to better match the brown pallete of the desert
	- Sound effects
		- Generic river
		- Rowing
		- Turning
		- Picking up energy
		- Bumping rocks
		- Bumping shoreline
	- More music
		- Multiple rotating songs for play screen
		- Song for the tutorial mode
	- New font
	- Art of buttons & tutorial dialogue
	- Some sort of animated component for the title screen (maybe particles of sand blowing in the wind?)
	- Death animation
	- Add in another (4th) unique rock sprite

Bugs
	- Rocks sometimes placed badly at transitions
	- You can kind of make out the boundaries of the shoreline tiles
	- Branches slightly bump the player and mess with their momentum
	- Boat rocking is simply based on (PlayerVelocity - RiverVelocity) and it looks wrong sometimes
		especially when facing backwards
	- Row wakes look wrong when facing backwards
	- Android version crashes after making it a certain distance
		Nobody else is experiencing this so I'll shelf it for now
	- The rock sprites has a few eroneous pixels on the edge

Balance


------------------------- Completed -------------------------

Features
	- Rocks and shoreline bump the player and slow them down rather than an immediate loss
	- "Active Reload" for rowing
	- Player proximity enhancements
		- Positive collectable that increases size of player proximity
		- Slowly decay over time
		- The player looses when the proximity decays too low
	- Add Screens		
		- How to play screen
		- Credits
		- Post play screen with stats of that play session
	- Add keyboard support
	- On keyboard & controller, have right mimic down and left mimic up
	- Release version # display in corner of main menu
	- While turning, add some lateral force to the boat that scales with speed relative to water
	- Increase rotational force if turning while rowing
	- Update tutorial to inform player how passive and collision energy decay scale with distance

Optimization
	- Put generation in background thread
		(Instead I spread tile generation out to only do 5 tiles per frame

Art
	- Add little particles that flow through the river
	- Add grass tiles above and below shoreline
	- Area of influence shader around the player that shows the river within but the desert without
	- Game play UI
		Turn up/down
		Row
	- Add Main menu art
	- Add music
	- Iterate on player character boat art
	- Particle effect from the oars when the player rows
	- Particle effect from the oars when the player turns
	- Add in rocking of the player boat modelled after a damped oscillator
	- Different sprites for rocks when inside and outside the player radius
	- Put black border around player boat
	- Move row indicator back to the right
	- Add in another (3rd) unique rock sprite
	- Iterate on energy art

Bugs
	- Player can accelerate backwards when they turn around and row
	- Travelling backwards allows the user to double count sections of river for distance travelled
	- River particles display outside of the player proximity
	- Rocks have a wake outside of player proximity
	- Player Wake
		- The wake renders on top of the player boat
		- The wake is enabled even when it has greater parallel velocity than the player
		(Moved the wake to simply be a higher render layer for the player)
	- Transitions at shoreline are sometimes blocky and choppy
		- Kinda solved by making transitions more gentle
	- Transition segments sometimes calculate the wrong starting slope
		- I don't think this was actually true. It looks better now that transitions are spread out over a larger domain
	- Turn wake particles move too fast
	- Wake particles are too small compared to row wake and turn wake particles
	- Balance volume of music between main menu and play screen so that they are the same volume

Balance
	- First half of rounds are kinda easy
		(Solved this with the active reload rowing feature; it makes everything pretty darn challenging)
	- Drastically reduce row force of red and yellow rows
	- Make turning be "force" based so the movement doesn't feel icy
	- Make collisions reduce radius based on speed of collision
	- Increase collision radius of energy
	- Make energy spawns less frequent when later in a run than earlier
	- Increase impact radius decay and passive radius decay with distance
