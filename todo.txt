------------------------ Outstanding ------------------------

Features
	- Rocks and shoreline bump the player and slow them down rather than an immediate loss
	- Daily challenge map based on today's date

Optimization

Art
	- Add Menus
	- Some sort of hazy effect or particle effect on the circumfrence of the player proximity ring
	- Iterate on generated tile art
	- Change rocks' color pallete to better match the brown pallete of the desert
	- Put black border around player boat

Bugs
	- Rocks sometimes placed badly at transitions
	- You can kind of make out the boundaries of the shoreline tiles
	- Branches slightly bump the player and mess with their momentum
	- Boat rocking is simply based on (PlayerVelocity - RiverVelocity) and it looks wrong sometimes
		especially when facing backwards
	- Row wakes look wrong when facing backwards

Balance
	- Rounds last kind of long


------------------------- Completed -------------------------

Features
	- "Active Reload" for rowing
	- Player proximity enhancements
		- Positive collectable that increases size of player proximity
		- Slowly decay over time
		- The player looses when the proximity decays too low

Optimization
	- Put generation in background thread
		(Instead I spread tile generation out to only do 5 tiles per frame

Art
	- Add little particles that flow through the river
	- Add grass tiles above and below shoreline
	- Area of influence shader around the player that shows the river within but the desert without
	- Game play UI
		Turn up/down
		Row
	- Add Main menu art
	- Add music
	- Iterate on player character boat art
	- Particle effect from the oars when the player rows
	- Particle effect from the oars when the player turns
	- Add in rocking of the player boat modelled after a damped oscillator
	- Different sprites for rocks when inside and outside the player radius

Bugs
	- Player can accelerate backwards when they turn around and row
	- Travelling backwards allows the user to double count sections of river for distance travelled
	- River particles display outside of the player proximity
	- Rocks have a wake outside of player proximity
	- Player Wake
		- The wake renders on top of the player boat
		- The wake is enabled even when it has greater parallel velocity than the player
		(Moved the wake to simply be a higher render layer for the player)
	- Transitions at shoreline are sometimes blocky and choppy
		- Kinda solved by making transitions more gentle
	- Transition segments sometimes calculate the wrong starting slope
		- I don't think this was actually true. It looks better now that transitions are spread out over a larger domain
	- Turn wake particles move too fast
	- Wake particles are too small compared to row wake and turn wake particles

Balance
	- First half of rounds are kinda easy
		(Solved this with the active reload rowing feature; it makes everything pretty darn challenging)
