Balance

-------------------------- Shelved --------------------------
Features
	- Add Screens		
		- Stats screen? (With things like # of attempts, best run, average run, etc.)
			Still maybe if there is interest
	- Rapids section where the water speed temporarily gets way faster???
		I don't hate this but idk how to indicate it is upcoming when outside the player radius

Optimization

Art
	- Iterate on generated tile art
		Sounds hard
	- Change rocks' color pallete to better match the brown pallete of the desert
		Sounds time consuming
	- Death animation
		If I want to see something crashing a burning I can just look at my life
	- Add in another (4th) unique rock sprite
		Nobody will notice except me

Bugs
	- Rocks sometimes placed badly at transitions
		Haven't seen this in a long time. Might be fixed?
	- You can kind of make out the boundaries of the shoreline tiles
		Nobody has really commented on it
	- Branches slightly bump the player and mess with their momentum
		I don't think this is an issue anymore for some reason
	- Boat rocking is simply based on (PlayerVelocity - RiverVelocity) and it looks wrong sometimes
		Ehh it looks good enough maybe?
	- Android version crashes after making it a certain distance
		Very few other people has experienced this

Balance
	- Remove rocks too close to an energy instead of trying to move the energy to the side
		I kinda like the chaos it can cause in the challenge modes
	- Increase turn speed when turning while rowing
		I actually like the incentive to go fast

------------------------- Completed -------------------------

Features
	- Daily challenge map based on today's date
	- Screen shake on collision
	- Vibration on row and/or collision
	- Rocks and shoreline bump the player and slow them down rather than an immediate loss
	- "Active Reload" for rowing
	- Player proximity enhancements
		- Positive collectable that increases size of player proximity
		- Slowly decay over time
		- The player looses when the proximity decays too low
	- Add Screens		
		- How to play screen
		- Credits
		- Post play screen with stats of that play session
		- Pause menu in play screen
			- Resume button
			- Restart Button
			- Quit button
		- Main Menu
		- Settings screen? (Might not actually need this)
			- Music toggle
			- Vibration
			- SFX toggle
			- Screen shake toggle
	- Add keyboard support
	- On keyboard & controller, have right mimic down and left mimic up
	- Release version # display in corner of main menu
	- While turning, add some lateral force to the boat that scales with speed relative to water
	- Increase rotational force if turning while rowing
	- Update tutorial to inform player how passive and collision energy decay scale with distance
	- Countdown for when new challenge maps are coming

Optimization
	- Put generation in background thread
		(Instead I spread tile generation out to only do 5 tiles per frame

Art
	- Add little particles that flow through the river
	- Add grass tiles above and below shoreline
	- Area of influence shader around the player that shows the river within but the desert without
	- Game play UI
		Turn up/down
		Row
	- Add Main menu art
	- Add music
	- Iterate on player character boat art
	- Particle effect from the oars when the player rows
	- Particle effect from the oars when the player turns
	- Add in rocking of the player boat modelled after a damped oscillator
	- Different sprites for rocks when inside and outside the player radius
	- Put black border around player boat
	- Move row indicator back to the right
	- Add in another (3rd) unique rock sprite
	- Iterate on energy art
	- Some sort of animated component for the title screen (maybe particles of sand blowing in the wind?)
	- Sound effects
		- Generic River
		- Rowing
		- Picking up energy

Bugs
	- Player can accelerate backwards when they turn around and row
	- Travelling backwards allows the user to double count sections of river for distance travelled
	- River particles display outside of the player proximity
	- Rocks have a wake outside of player proximity
	- Player Wake
		- The wake renders on top of the player boat
		- The wake is enabled even when it has greater parallel velocity than the player
		(Moved the wake to simply be a higher render layer for the player)
	- Transitions at shoreline are sometimes blocky and choppy
		- Kinda solved by making transitions more gentle
	- Transition segments sometimes calculate the wrong starting slope
		- I don't think this was actually true. It looks better now that transitions are spread out over a larger domain
	- Turn wake particles move too fast
	- Wake particles are too small compared to row wake and turn wake particles
	- Balance volume of music between main menu and play screen so that they are the same volume
	- Increase pressable size of turning buttons
	- Remove pressable area of row button on left half of screen
	- Pause boat rocking animation on death
	- In the tutorial, highlight both the rock and energy before letting the player play again

Balance
	- First half of rounds are kinda easy
		(Solved this with the active reload rowing feature; it makes everything pretty darn challenging)
	- Drastically reduce row force of red and yellow rows
	- Make turning be "force" based so the movement doesn't feel icy
	- Make collisions reduce radius based on speed of collision
	- Increase collision radius of energy
	- Make energy spawns less frequent when later in a run than earlier
	- Increase impact radius decay and passive radius decay with distance
